# Database Schema â€“ Airbnb Clone

This SQL script (`schema.sql`) defines the full relational database schema for the Airbnb Clone project. It includes:

- Users
- Properties
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews
- Messages

Each table includes proper keys, foreign constraints, and data types as defined in the original specification. Indexes have also been added for query performance optimization.
